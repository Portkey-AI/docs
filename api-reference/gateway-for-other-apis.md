# Gateway for other APIs

The LLM providers you're using might support other endpoints than the one's supported by Portkey. The gateway support directly proxying the requests for them.

You can call the endpoint by adding it after `https://api.portkey.ai/v1`

We identify the provider and parameters needed based on the `mode` or the `virtual_key` passed in the header or the config object.

### Example

Let's take an example of using the Cohere Rerank API (which is not directly documented here)

The cohere endpoint for this is `/rerank`

We'll create a virtual key for cohere in the UI and use that to make the call through Portkey or just use the mode as `cohere`.&#x20;

**Sample cURL request using the virtual key (recommended)**

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY' \
     --header 'x-portkey-api-virtual-key: $VIRTUAL_KEY' \
     --data '
{
  "return_documents": false,
  "max_chunks_per_doc": 10,
  "model": "rerank-english-v2.0",
  "query": "What is the capital of the United States?",
  "documents": [
    "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada.",
    "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan.",
    "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district.",
    "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states."
  ]
}
'
```

**Sample cURL request using mode**

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $COHERE_API_KEY' \
     --header 'x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY' \
     --header 'x-portkey-mode: proxy cohere' \
     --data '
{
  "return_documents": false,
  "max_chunks_per_doc": 10,
  "model": "rerank-english-v2.0",
  "query": "What is the capital of the United States?",
  "documents": [
    "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada.",
    "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan.",
    "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district.",
    "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states."
  ]
}
'
```

### SDK Usage

Portkey SDKs expose 2 special functions to enable method calls like this:

**`portkey.post(url, requestParams)`** and **`portkey.get(url[, requestParams])`**

Make these calls with the relevant headers and configParams as all other requests.

**Sample request for cohere rerank**
