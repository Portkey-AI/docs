# Response Schema

With each request, Portkey sends back **Portkey-specific** headers that can help you identify the state of  specific Portkey features you are using.

We send the following 4 response headers:

<table><thead><tr><th width="345">Header</th><th width="405">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><code>x-portkey-trace-id</code></strong></td><td>Returns a <strong>unique trace id</strong> for each response.<br><br>In case the user has already sent a trace id with <code>x-portkey-trace-id</code> in their <strong>request body,</strong> then that is used here instead of generating a new id.</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>x-portkey-retry-attempt-count</code></strong></td><td>Returns the number of <strong>retry attempts</strong> made for the call. <br><br>Request made for the first time is not counted, <strong>only</strong> the attempts are counted. So, if the value is 3, that means that a total of 4 (1+3) calls were made.</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>x-portkey-cache-status</code></strong></td><td>Returns the <strong>cache status</strong> for the call. <br><br>• <code>HIT</code> (simple cache hit)<br>• <code>SEMANTIC HIT</code> (semantic cache hit)<br>• <code>MISS</code> (simple cache header was sent in the request, but returned a miss)<br>• <code>SEMANTIC MISS</code> (semantic cache header was sent in the request, but returned a miss)<br>• <code>DISABLED</code> (no cache header sent)<br>• <code>REFRESH</code> (cache force refresh was true in the request header)</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>x-portkey-last-used-option-index</code></strong></td><td>Returns the nested <strong>target index</strong> (as jsonpath) for the Config id used while making the call.</td></tr></tbody></table>
