# ðŸ“Š Logs & Analytics

One of the many advantages of integrating with Portkey is the detailed logs and analytics provided directly on the Portkey dashboard. Once your application is integrated with Portkey, this feature is enabled automatically, providing you with valuable insights into your application's usage patterns and performance.

This feature does not require any additional headers to be passed in your requests. As soon as the Portkey integration is done, all logs and analytics will begin to appear in the Portkey dashboard.

The Logs and Analytics section is split into two parts:

### 1. Analytics

The Analytics section of the Portkey dashboard provides a visual and interactive interface for understanding your LLM application  Here, you can see various graphs and metrics related to requests to different LLMs, costs, latencies, tokens, user activity, feedback, cache hits, errors, and much more.

The metrics in the Analytics section can help you understand the overall efficiency of your application, discover patterns, identify areas of optimization, and much more.

### 2. Logs

The Logs section presents a chronological list of all the requests processed through Portkey. Each log entry provides useful data such as the timestamp, request type, LLM used, tokens generated, and cost. By clicking on an entry, a side panel opens up, revealing the entire raw data with the request and response objects.

This detailed log can be invaluable when troubleshooting issues or understanding specific interactions. It provides full transparency into each request and response, enabling you to see exactly what data was sent and received.
