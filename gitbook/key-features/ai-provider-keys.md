**Did You Know?** You can add multiple keys for the same provider **and** also add the same key under different names for ease of identification.

Currently, Portkey supports:

* OpenAI
* Anthropic
* Cohere
* Azure OpenAI
* **Coming Soon**: HuggingFace ðŸš€

### **Understanding Virtual Keys:**

Safety first! Portkey transforms your provider key into a virtual key to use within the Portkey ecosystem. This ensures that your original provider keys remain secure and untouched.

### What's on the Horizon?

Portkey's virtual keys are about to get even more powerful:

* **Cost Limits**: Set expenditure caps on each virtual key. Once the limit's hit, the key deactivates.
* **Role-Based Access**: Define who in your organization gets to use which key. Keep everything in the right hands.
* **Usage Settings**: Want a key for a specific function? You'll soon be able to define exact use cases for each key.
