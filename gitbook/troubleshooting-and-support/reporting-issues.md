# ðŸ“¥ Reporting Issues

Despite your best troubleshooting efforts and our own testing efforts, there may be times when you come across an issue that isn't resolved. When this happens, it's time to report the problem to our Portkey support team. Here's a quick guide on how to do this effectively:

### 1. Gather Relevant Information

To help our team address your issue swiftly and accurately, please gather as much of the following information as possible:

* **Description of the issue**: Include any error messages you are seeing and describe the behavior you're experiencing and how it differs from your expectations.
* **Steps to reproduce the issue**: Provide clear steps on how we can reproduce the issue on our end.
* **Code Samples**: If possible, share code snippets that are causing the error. Ensure you've removed any sensitive data before sharing.
* **Request and Response Data**: If applicable, include the request you're making and the response you're receiving. Ensure any sensitive data is redacted.
* **Screenshots or Screen Recordings**: Visuals can help us understand and diagnose issues faster. If possible, include screenshots or screen recordings.
* **Environment Details**: Share details about your environment. For example, are you using a specific programming language or library? What's the version? Are you seeing the issue in all environments (development, production, etc.)?

### 2. Contact Our Support Team

Once you've gathered this information, it's time to reach out to our support team. You can contact us through the following channels:

* **Email**: You can email us at [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai).
* **Github**: If you're using one of our open-source projects and believe the issue lies there, you can create an issue directly on the relevant Github repository.
* **Enterprise Customers** can directly reach out to our team via slack connect.

When describing your issue, please be as detailed as possible. Include all of the information you gathered in step 1. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for us to understand and resolve your issue.

### 3. Await Our Response
