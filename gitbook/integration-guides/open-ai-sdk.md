# âž¡ Open AI SDK

In the following code snippets, the `api_base` is changed to Portkey's base path.

The Portkey API key and mode are passed in the request headers. You need to replace `<PORTKEY_API_KEY>` with your actual Portkey API key. The mode is set as **`proxy openai`** which is the Portkey middleware mode for OpenAI.

```python
import openai

# Set Portkey as the base path
openai.api_base = "https://api.portkey.ai/v1/proxy"

response = openai.Completion.create(
  model="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'",
  temperature=0.5,
  headers={
    "x-portkey-api-key": "<PORTKEY_API_KEY>",
    "x-portkey-mode": "proxy openai"
  }
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="NodeJS" %}
```typescript
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: "<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
  basePath: "https://api.portkey.ai/v1/proxy",
    baseOptions: {
      headers: {
        "x-portkey-api-key": "<PORTKEY_API_KEY>",
        "x-portkey-mode": "proxy openai"
      }
    }
});

const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

async function generateCompletion() {
  const response = await openai.createCompletion({
    model: "text-davinci-003",
    prompt: "Two roads diverged in the yellow woods",
    max_tokens: 512,
    temperature: 0,
  });

  console.log(response.data.choices[0].text);
}

generateCompletion();
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Each of the above code snippets perform the same operation - generating text based on a prompt using OpenAI's API via Portkey's middleware.

Remember, you can leverage more Portkey features by including appropriate headers in your requests. For instance, you can enable request caching by adding the `"x-portkey-cache": "simple"` or `"x-portkey-cache": "semantic"` header, depending on the caching mechanism you want to use.

Likewise, you can enable request retries by adding the `"x-portkey-retry-count": <no_of_retries>` header, and so on. Refer to the Portkey Headers document for more details on enabling/disabling different features using headers.
