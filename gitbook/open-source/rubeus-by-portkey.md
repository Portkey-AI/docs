# Rubeus by Portkey

Rubeus is an open-source AI gateway that reflects Portkey's commitment to productionizing LLM systems. Engineered for blazing-fast performance, Rubeus can be either self-hosted or set up on edge, serving as a cohesive interface for all LLM interactions.

Rubeus streamlines 20+ LLMs under a unified interace and makes them interoperable so you can swap out a model or a provider without changing underlying code. On top of this, to make your app production-grade, Rubeus adds features like automated fallbacks & retries and load balacing to your systems with a single line code change.

**For a detailed overview and list of supported providers,** [**please visit the Rubeus Github repo**](https://github.com/portkey-ai/rubeus)**.**
