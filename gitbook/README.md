# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Portkey!

> ### You are on our old documentation. For the most current guides and documentation, please visit [https://portkey.ai/docs](https://portkey.ai/docs).

Scaling LLM apps to production is laden with unexpected and often unprecedented challenges such as:

* Increasing latencies
* Request failures with unexplainable errors
* Rate limiting
* Poor visibility
* Abuse of systems
* Poor key management
* Privacy complications with client data
* ...and more.

Portkey is engineered to address **all** these challenges and augment your LLM systems with additional production capabilitiesâ€”requiring minimal modifications to your existing code.
