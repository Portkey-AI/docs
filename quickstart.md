# Quickstart

This guide allows you to integrate with Portkey in a minute.

## 1. Create an account
You can create an account on Portkey with your work email address and get the authentication key needed later in the integration.

## 2. Insert the Portkey endpoint
Replace the OpenAI (or any other provider’s) endpoint to the portkey proxy endpoint and add the portkey authentication headers.
