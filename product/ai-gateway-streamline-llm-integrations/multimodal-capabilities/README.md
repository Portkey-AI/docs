# Multimodal Capabilities

The Gateway is **also** your unified interface for **multimodal models**, and not just chat/text/embedding models. Using the Gateway, you can call `vision`, `audio`, `image gen` and other multimodal models  from multiple providers (like `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `Stability AI`, etc.) â€” all using the familiar OpenAI signature.
