# Organizations

Organizations in Portkey represent the highest level of abstraction within an account. They serve as containers for all users, entities, and workspaces (if the feature is enabled) associated with your company or project.

Key aspects of Organizations:

* **Comprehensive Scope:** An organization encompasses all the users and entities within it, providing a broad view of your entire operation.
* **Workspace Support:** Organizations can contain workspaces, which act as sub-organizations for more granular team management and project scoping.
* **Hierarchical Roles:** Organizations have owners and org admins who have access to all workspaces and can create and use admin keys.
* **Multi-Org Flexibility:** Portkey offers an org switcher, allowing users to switch between different organizations they have access to.
* **Security Features:** SSO (Single Sign-On) settings are applied at the organization level, enhancing security and user management.
* **Private Cloud Integration:** When deploying a gateway in a private cloud, the connection to the control panel is established at the organization level.

Organizations provide a robust framework for managing large-scale AI development projects, enabling efficient resource allocation, access control, and team management across your entire operation.
