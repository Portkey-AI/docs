# Feedback APIs

When evaluating an LLM system, an important metric to record is real human feedback coming in. In your application you can collect feedback with a simple thumbs up / thumbs down or go deeper with weighted feedback on actions that the user takes.

Portkey allows you to capture this feedback on a generation or conversation level. The feedback can then be analysed on a prompt, user or environment level.

Feedbacks in Portkey are collected on a `trace-id` level which can be configured by you.

Here's the [Postman collection](https://universal-crescent-500341.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~d4bdd90e-1e8f-4aec-88bd-0db2590e5f66) to try out the feedback API.

### WIP

This documentation is WIP and we'll be adding code snippets and screenshots soon.
