# Open Source

## [Portkey AI Gateway](https://github.com/portkey-ai/rubeus)

We have open sourced our battle-tested AI Gateway to the community - it connects to 100+ LLMs with a unified interface and a single endpoint, and lets you effortlessly setup fallbacks, load balancing, retries, and more.

This gateway is in production at Portkey processing billions of tokens every day.

## [Gateway Reports](https://portkey.ai/blog/tag/benchmarks/)

We collaborate with the community to dive deep into how the LLMs & their inference providers are performing at scale, and publish gateway reports. We track latencies, uptime, cost changes, fluctuations across various modalitites like time-of-day, regions, token-lengths, and more.
