[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S5Jb2tTOSbE0ZMSRJ5-z3ks1T11AnmxZ?usp=sharing)

## Use Mixtral-8X22B with Portkey

```python
!pip install -qU portkey-ai openai
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, createHeaders
from google.colab import userdata
```

You will need Portkey and Together AI API keys to run this notebook.

* Sign up for Portkey and generate your API key [here](https://app.portkey.ai/)
* Get your Together AI key [here](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys)

### With OpenAI Client

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, createHeaders

client = OpenAI(
    api_key= userdata.get('TOGETHER_API_KEY'), ## replace it your Together API key
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    default_headers=createHeaders(
        provider="together-ai",
        api_key= userdata.get('PORTKEY_API_KEY'), ## replace it your Portkey API key
    )
)

chat_complete = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B",
    messages=[{"role": "user",
               "content": "What's a fractal?"}],
)

print(chat_complete.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Portkey Client

Note: You can safely store your Together API key in [Portkey](https://app.portkey.ai/) and access models using virtual key

```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key = userdata.get('PORTKEY_API_KEY'),   # replace with your Portkey API key
    virtual_key= "together-1c20e9",   # replace with your virtual key for Together AI
)
```

```python
completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Who are you?'}],
    model= 'mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B',
    max_tokens=250
)

print(completion)
```

### Observability with Portkey

By routing requests through Portkey you can track a number of metrics like - tokens used, latency, cost, etc.

Here's a screenshot of the dashboard you get with Portkey!
